# Tilefun

**Mario Maker meets Zelda, for little kids, extensible with AI.**

A creative-mode-first 2D tile game — paint terrain, place entities, hit play, and live in the world you built. Seamless edit/play toggle, no scripting required. Designed for young children and parent co-op.

LAN multiplayer is in the works — parent crafts the world while the kid plays in it.
