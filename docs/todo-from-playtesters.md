## From daughter (Feb 2025)

- Pick flowers and sell them for diamonds
- Create bouquets from picked flowers
- Trade bouquets with other players for diamonds
- Mounted animals should keep wandering on their own, but player can override with movement controls
- Cars! Jump onto them and ride on top (new entity type needed)
- Player should be invulnerable to enemies while riding a mount
- Limit bad ghosts to max 3 on screen (extras should disappear); no limit on good ghosts
